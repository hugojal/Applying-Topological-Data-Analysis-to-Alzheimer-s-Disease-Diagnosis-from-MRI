This repository proposes three machine learning algorithms that succesfully classify the presence of Alzheimer's Disease based on brain morphologies. This model is trained on the oasis longitudinal dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers). The model achieves an accuracy of 81-84%. This model can run on Google Colab.
