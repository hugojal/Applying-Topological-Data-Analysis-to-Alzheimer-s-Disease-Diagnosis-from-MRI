👩‍🔬This repository proposes five machine learning algorithms that successfully classify the presence of Alzheimer's Disease based on brain morphologies. This model is trained on the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset. The models were run on Google Collab. 

🧑‍🔬Under the supervision of Dr.Leming, we developed a Linear TDA model with Gudhi Library that obtained an accuracy score of 83.9% and a Stochastic TDA model with Persistence Images that obtained a score of 94.85%.
