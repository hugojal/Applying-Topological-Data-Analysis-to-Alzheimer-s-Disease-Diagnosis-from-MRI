We noticed a research gap in predicting the severity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as current models have at best between an 80-90% chance of predicting AD in its early stages (Kavitha et al., 2022).  

As such, we intend to implement a stochastic-based model in hopes of improving this accuracy rating. Successes in similar areas can be seen in "An efficient stochastic based model for simulating microelectrode recordings of the deep brain" which uses stochastic methods to enhance the Deep Brain Stimulationn (DBS) method of combating Parkinson's Disease (Weegink et al., 2012), and more directly in "Stochastic model of Alzheimer’s Disease progression using two-state Markov chains - PMC" (nih.gov) which analyses AD with stochastic methods, but does not reach a conclusion as to the superiority of stochastic methods over deterministic ones (Parks, 2023). 

So far, we have implemented 11 algorithms that have been able to classify MRIs in different categories ranging from non-demented to highly-demented. For the main part of our project, we aim to improve a stochastic algorithm (MLPClassifier.py) that we have already coded—which achieved an accuracy value of 93%. 

Ultimately, we hope to provide a less invasive and ideally more accurate model for identifying patients who are at risk for AD.
